# presentations

### What is it?
This is a collection of miscellaneous studies on various topics. [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is required to open files with *.ipynb* extension (which are structured presentations with texts, visualizations, and code cells). However, since GitHub is able to render Jupyter notebooks, formatted outputs can be viewed via browser too.

### Where to look for details?
Each notebook from the repository contains a section with problem description. In addition, all non-trivial findings are commented near corresponding cells.
