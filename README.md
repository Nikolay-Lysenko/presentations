### What is it?
This is a collection of miscellaneous studies on various topics. Since GitHub is able to render Jupyter notebooks, formatted outputs can be seen right there. In other words, structured files with texts, visualizations, and code cells might be viewed there.

### Where to look for details?
Each notebook from the repository contains a section with problem description. Also all non-trivial findings are commented near corresponding cells.
